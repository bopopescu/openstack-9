    Fix ability to add custom volume_backend_name
    
    This patch fixes the ability to set the volume_backend_name
    for each driver.   The original bug was filed against LeftHand
    and 3PAR, but several drivers exhibited a fixed backend name.
    
    Fixes: bug #1175222

    Add parsing to extra-specs key check
    
    When using the filter scheduler which is now the default,
    we can no longer pass in extra-specs like: {minIOPS:500, ....},
    because the capabilities filter will reject this because there is
    no host reporting minIOPS:500 capabilities.
    
    We now need to scope the keys (ie qos:minIOPS:500....), but
    that unfortunately requires a fix to the SolidFire driver.
    
    This change add a check for the ':' in the key, and parses
    on it if it's there.
    
    Also fixes backend_name and uses VERSION var instead of
    generating string in stats reporting.

    ThinLVM driver was missing the newly required capabilities reporting
    and inheritance from the parent LVM driver doesn't work because the
    capacity reporting methods between regular LVM and Thin LVM are not
    compatible.

    Fix update snapshot-quotas on delete.
    
    The merge from stable to RC of the snapshot quota
    fixes missed the new CONF usage and as a result the
    setting was always ignored on delete and therefore
    quotas were not decremented on delete.
    
    This patch changes CONF back to FLAGS for that call and
    resolves the issue.

    Remove Flags usage from cinder.volume.driver
    
    cinder.volume.driver was using a mix of FLAGS and the
    new conf options for multi-backend.  The result was failure
    of multi-backend configrations to set the iscsi_helper
    option.
    
    This updates the driver.py file to use the OSLO.cfg and fixes the
    check for iscsi_helper check in the initialize_connection call,
    which was undefined.

    Fix quota updating when admin deletes common user's volume
    
    Add 'project_id=None' optional argument in QUOTAS related methods.
    
    There are two problems when admin deletes volumes of common user
    before fixing this bug:
    Firstly, It will get tenant quotas using context.project_id which
    results in getting admin's quotas not common user's.
    Secondly, It will also get wrong quota usages using context.project_id
    when updating common user's quota_usages.
    
    So we could pass into QUOTAS related methods an optional argument to
    specify the tenant ID to be affected. And if it's not set, then we
    default to drawing the tenant ID from the context.

    Fixed shared gigabytes quota resource.
    
    The shared gigabytes resource between volumes and snapshots wasn't
    working properly.  The issue was that on update/sync the action item
    (volumes or snapshots) would update the resource usages based only on
    it's own particular item.
    
    This patch fixes that, and makes the total gigabytes truly shared
    between volumesa and snapshots.

    Should validate the GET variable 'limit' before query database to get a
    consistent message with Cinder REST API v1.
    By current implement, error message is as below if the variable 'limit'
    is invalid:
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    {"computeFault": {"message": "The server has either erred or is incapable
    of performing the requested operation.", "code": 500}}
    
    After this change, the new message is as below:
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    {"badRequest": {"message": "limit param must be an integer", "code": 400}}

    CoraidDriver: support users that are not admin
    
    Add support to the CoraidDriver to specify a subgroup (with admin
    privileges).
    Coraid storage orchestration allows you to allocate portions of your
    SAN to specific users/groups.
    The driver should support this and not assume logging in
    as "admin" (equiv to "root").
    
    Will add another parameter to cinder.conf, "coraid_group",
    and if present, the driver will authenticate using the specified group
    as well as the already available coraid_user parameter.

    Last driver sync for Folsom and Grizzly
    
    This is the last of the updates that I've been putting
    off while trying to handle the core items in Cinder.
    
    This change fixes the ctxt ordering error in volume_types
    and also fixes and also changes the internal SolidFire
    metadata storage to a single dict instead of a dict of dicts.

    Pull Oslo log fix to enable root logger initialization
    
    Previous log module in Oslo doesn't initialize root logger, which results
    in lacking of log message for non-openstack library (such as stevedore).
    This patch pull latest log module from Oslo, which has recently merged a
    change to enable root logger initialization.
    
    Notice that this change also includes one log modules fix in Oslo which
    'unignore' log_format setting.  As a result, one may experience log format
    change when using devstack.  To get old log format back, simply assign
    a NULL string (aka nothing) to 'log_format' configure option in cinder.conf.
    For example, just append cinder.conf with one new line 'log_format = '.

    Count Snapshots towards volume/gigabyte quotas.
    
    Cinder has quotas and limits for volume-count and Gigabytes used,
    however we were only counting volumes against these quotas.
    
    This change introduces a snapshot-count limit and also counts
    snapshots against this Gigabytes quota allowed for a Tenant.

    Fix 3PAR driver hiding existing host error
    
    This fixes a problem with the 3par drivers where creating
    a 3par host was failing but there was no message.  The driver
    would fail to find the host after the creation failed and the
    log entry would show that the host didn't exist.   The real
    error was failing to create the host.

    This fixes two bugs for Huawei iscsi driver.
    (1)If firstly we map LUN 1(just not LUN 0) to host,we can also
    find LUN 0 mapped,whose device path is '-'.Then we will failed
    to map a real LUN 0.So,we avoid mapping LUN 0 to host by setting
    every volume's host LUN ID larger than 0,instead of generating it
    automatically.
    (2)Check valid size of resource pools when creating snapshot and
    make sure it larger than 1 GB.

    Do not use prefix to lookup host in Storwize/SVC.
    
    Currently, the Storwize/SVC driver creates a host name prefix for host
    objects on the back-end, and uses that to look up hosts. However, if a
    host was already created with a different name (for example, manually
    by an admin), the host creation operation will fail, as a host with
    that connection information already exists. Instead, we look up a host
    based on available connection information.

    Update tox.ini to support RHEL 6.x.
    
    In order to support running unit tests on RHEL 6.x we need to patch
    eventlet with contrib/redhat-eventlet.patch. We already
    have support for this in the tools/install_venv_common.py but we
    need to make a couple changes to allow tox to consume this:
    
    1) Sync in the latest intall_venv_common.py from oslo. This changes
     patch to use the -N option (ignore already applied patches) and
     makes it safe to call the patching function more than once.
    
    2) Add a new patch_tox_venv.py script in tools.
    
    3) Update tox.ini to call patch_tox_venv.py before it runs tests and
     coverage.
    
    NOTE: This will hopefully go away eventually once this patch lands:

    Pull newly merged Olso update for 'is' operator
    
    A recent update to common/scheduler/filters/extra_specs_ops.py in
    Oslo added new 'is' operator to allow Boolean check. The original
    commit message was:
    
    "Boolean values for capabilities don't work because extra_specs are
    all converted to unicode. The scheduler will then check, for example,
    if the boolean 'True' is equal to the unicode string 'True', and will
    always return False. This patch allows admins to specify '<is> True'
    in extra_specs, which will compare successfully to boolean True."
    
    Notice extra_specs_ops now relies on strutils from Olso, so this
    change pull strutils from Oslo as well.

    Fixed copy image to volume and clone volume.
    
    This patch fixed the following issues in EMC driver found during G3 testing:
    1. VNX array has two storage processors and it is doing load balancing when
    attaching a LUN to a host. The storage processor used to attach a LUN to a
    host is different from the one discovered by the driver sometimes, causing
    Copy Image to Volume to fail.
    2. The clone relationship is removed after a volume is successfully
    cloned. However, this happens too soon sometimes before the cloned volume
    is fully synced with the source volume.  The fix is to wait until it is
    fully synced.

    The Storwize/SVC driver supports both FC and iSCSI protocols

    or storage_protocol='<in> FC'.

    swift backup service checks version during restore
    
    Modified swift backup service to check metadata version during restore
    and raise an error if the backup version isn't a version that the
    service knows how to handle. The versions which can be handled are
    described in a dictionary mapping versions to methods which can handle
    them. This will facilitate graceful handling of newer backup formats by
    the swift backup service when we introduce changes.

    Add some useful log to filter scheduler.
    
    When the filter scheduler is unable to find a suitable host to
    deploy a volume on it simply logged a warning "not hosts found".
    This isn't very helpful, so this patch adds some logging info as
    far as why no valid host was available.  This just focuses on the
    capacity filtering as that's where I've commonly seen this issue
    particularly in tempest runs.
    
    Also noticed that the get status was checking for "if Not capacity",
    but this is wrong because free capacity==0 would be interpretted as
    failing to get capacity.  Change this to "if is None".

    Elevate context for delete volume with no host.
    
    So in the case of a volume that is placed in error state
    on create and never actually deployed, the cinder.volume.api delete
    call does a short cut call to db.destroy_volume which is fine because
    all we have is a DB entry (scheduler never deployed the volume).
    
    Unfortunately, this requires admin context, so just add an elevate
    context to the db.destroy_volume call.

    Improve logging for volume operations via manager
    
    A large percentage of the logging information was

    NetApp: Fix race condition in 7-mode iSCSI driver with DFM.
    
    A race condition was discovered in the driver while creating
    or deleting multiple volumes in a very short interval of time
    (can be reproduced by making successive API calls to Cinder).
    This fix decorates the methods responsible for race condition
    with a synchronized() decorator. The problem was with the
    management software: DFM, and in principle, there should not
    be two processes trying to modify the DFM dataset object at
    the same time. This patch prevents from such a possibility.

    Cinder devref doc cleanups
    
    Way back when Cinder was inagurated as a separate project, the docs
    directory from Nova was used as a seed for the one in the Cinder repo
    
    This patch is simply cleaning out images and files which have no
    relation to Cinder at all, and are at best extremely outdated when
    applied to Nova.
    
    Aside from the deletions which are mainly images, and files related
    to the configuration of CloudPipe, there is one modification to
    conf.py which simply removes a reference to a vmware doc that no
    longer exists.

    Fix stale volume list for NetApp 7-mode ISCSI driver
    
    While contacting filer through DFM in order to create volume from
    snapshot, the operation may fail with an error "No entry in LUN
    table for volume". Although the LUN representing the volume was
    created on the filer, the LUN list was not refreshed in time, which
     caused an error. This fix handles this situation for creating
    volume from snapshots.
    
    Note that this fix adds the requirement that the driver host and
    DFM machine should be reasonably time-synchronized.
    
    Fixes bug 1095633

    The cfg API is now available via the oslo-config library, so switch to

    Add the 2013.1b3 tarball to tools/pip-requires - this will be changed
    to 'oslo-config>=2013.1' when oslo-config is published to pypi. This
    will happen in time for grizzly final.
    
    Add dependency_links to setup.py so that oslo-config can be installed
    from the tarball URL specified in pip-requires.
    
    Remove the 'deps = pep8==1.3.3' from tox.ini as it means all the other
    deps get installed with easy_install which can't install oslo-config
    from the URL.

    HP 3PAR Fibre Channel Driver and iSCSI Updates
    
    This is the initial FC driver for the HP 3PAR array, along with some
    3PAR iSCSI driver cleanup and changes in the HP 3PAR common class.
    Summary of changes:
    * Initial FC Driver for the Grizzly release (depends on the FC base class
      and nova FC changes https://review.openstack.org/#/c/19992/ &
      https://review.openstack.org/#/c/20003/)
    * Updates to iSCSI Driver include volume type and create clone volume support
      as well as general cleanup(comments, copyright, minor bug fixes).
    * The tests have been updated to add FC test and the file was renamed
      to reflect both FC and iSCSI 3PAR tests.
    * Volume types added for the Grizzly release include cpg, snap_cpg, persona
      and provisioning(thin vs. full)

    Fibre Channel base class for Cinder drivers
    
    This is the base class, FibreChannelDriver, for all fibre channel
    drivers to extend. Currently, it has only initialize_connection
    with comments, but this will be a place to put common functions
    similar to the iSCSI base class.
    
    This patch depends on the following nova and devstack changes
    to be functional(both still in the review process but approved
    for Grizzly):
    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/19992/
    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/20003/
    
    This patch does not support copy_image_to_volume and
    copy_volume_to_image in the Grizzly release. We'll revisit
    this in Havana and add that support.

    Add a safe_minidom_parse_string function.
    
    Adds a new utils.safe_minidom_parse_string function and
    updates external API facing Cinder modules to use it.
    This ensures we have safe defaults on our incoming API XML parsing.
    
    Internally safe_minidom_parse_string uses a ProtectedExpatParser
    class to disable DTDs and entities from being parsed when using
    minidom.

    Add a volume driver in Cinder for Scality SOFS
    
    Scality SOFS is a network filesystem mounted with FUSE, with most
    options given in a configuration file. Given a mount point and a SOFS
    configuration file as driver options, the Scality volume driver mounts
    SOFS, and then creates, accesses and deletes volumes as regular
    (sparse) files on SOFS.

    Fix create volume from image.
    
    Fix for bug 1129199
    
    During creating a volume from an image, the volume status changed
    from creating to active, skipping the download phase. This bug was most
    likely introduced during:
    https://review.openstack.org/20514
    This patch fixes the issue by change image_location back to image_id at
    the correct place.
    This patch also fixes an error in the exception handling, and the update
    of the volume status after creation.

    XenAPINFS: fix capacity reporting
    
    Fixes bug 1129056
    
    XenAPINFS did not implement the get_volume_stats method, thus
    CapacityFilter fitered out the host, thus no volume was scheduled. This
    fix is working around this problem quickly, by reporting an 'unknown'
    capacity.

    Add get_cluster_stats to SolidFire driver
    
    With the filter scheduler addition we added get_stats to the
    drivers.  This provides the required data for the filtering
    mechanisms and is called by the scheduler.
    
    The change adds the required call in the driver and also adds
    an update routine to it's init to populate this info on startup.
    This also adds the fake api response so that the tests can perform
    the init routine and get the data, while giving the added bonus of
    testing the new functions at the same time.

    1. Merged with Avishay's changes(https://review.openstack.org/#/c/
    19808/3) and removed copy volume<->image from my driver.
    2. Also did some refactoring based on Mike's comments
    last time (See https://review.openstack.org/#/c/19979/).
    Made the following changes in emc_smis_common:
    - Added a member variable conn to save get_ecom_connection
    and moved exceptions inside the helper function get_ecom_connection.
    - Also moved exceptions inside find_pool and get_storage_type.
    - Added test cases so get_ecom_connection, find_pool, and
    get_storage_type will be covered.
    3. Made changes in emc_smis_common to handle both iscsi and fc.

    This driver enables use of GlusterFS in a similar fashion
    as the NFS driver.  It supports basic volume operations,
    and like NFS, does not support snapshot/clone.
    
    To enable, set volume_driver to
     cinder.volume.drivers.glusterfs.GlusterfsDriver
    
    Note that this requires a Nova libvirt GlusterFS driver
    as well.
    
    Adds config options: glusterfs_shares_config,
    glusterfs_mount_point_base, glusterfs_disk_util, and
    glusterfs_sparsed_volumes.

    Fix ordering of function args
    
    Previous change swapped context and type-id params in function
    declaration.  Put it back.
    
    Also, no reason for storing the qos dict in the parameters, if
    it's stored then we continuously have to update it, remove that
    for now and come up with a cleaner method later.

    Add an ID to temporary volume snapshot object
    
    The create_cloned_volum method creates a temp snapshot and
    when it's done it uses the standard snapshot_delete method
    in the LVM driver.
    
    A change was added that logs a statement using the object[id],
    but we weren't actually setting this on our temp object so we
    would get a trace fo key DNE.  This change adds an id key to
    our temp object.

    Allow create_volume() to retry when exception happened
    
    Due to the fact that certain volume back-ends cannot easily report
    simple total_capacity_gb/free_capacity_gb for their internal
    implementation complexity, scheduler is updated to let those back-ends
    who report unclear capacity pass capacity filter, thus there is chance
    create_volume() request would fail. In a more general case, when a
    volume back-end failed to serve create_volume request for whatever reason
    it'd be good that we have a mechanism to 'retry' the request.
    
    So the idea is when volume manager catches the exception from
    driver.create_volume() call, it checks if the request is allowed to be
    rescheduled (requests that are not: clone volume and create volume from
    snapshot while 'snapshot_same_host' option is true), it composes a new
    request back to scheduler with additional information to mark this specific
    back-end has been tried (so that scheduler may choose to skip this back-end
    if needed).  Scheduler is (filter scheduler only, simple and chance
    scheduler is not supported) is updated as well so that it only retry
    scheduler_max_attempts times.  In order to skip/rule out previously tried
    back-ends in next schedule task, a new RetryFilter is added.
    
    Changes:
    1) volume RPC API create_volume() is updated with new parameters
    to save original request information in case rescheduling is needed.
    This bumps volume RPC API to 1.4.
    
    2) implementation of create_volume() method in volume API is
    refactored in order to distinguish if a request is allowed to
    do reschedule (i.e. currently create volume from source volume
    bypasses scheduler, not rescheduling is allowed).
    
    3) add reschedule functionality in create_volume() of volume
    manager so that it's able to send the request back to scheduler.
    
    4) add schedule_max_attempts config option in scheduler/driver.py
    
    5) add RetryFitler
    
    6) change scheduler_driver default option to FilterScheduler

    Fixes the provisioning on selected volumes for NetApp 7 mode.
    
    The current direct driver for 7 mode provisions openstack
    volume on all NetApp 7 mode volumes mixing openstack volumes
    with all non openstack volumes. This fix allows volume selection
    by the user to keep openstack volumes separate from non opnestack
    block storage entities.

    make test_databases instance variable
    
    eventually we'll need to do this to allow for testr testing, but in
    doing so this also exposed that sqlite downgrade of source_volid
    didn't work when data was in the table (sqlite just happily ignored
    the drop, then failed when trying to added the column for a second
    time during the snake walk.)
    
    This fix also adds the correct sqlite downgrade path for migration
    005 to actually drop source_volid, but ensure we don't loose any
    other data in the process.

    XenAPINFS: Copy image from glance
    
    related to blueprint xenapinfs-glance-integration
    
    This change is using the glance xenapi plugin to copy a glance image to
    a xenapinfs backed volume. It slightly differs from the reference
    implementation, as this implementation is composed of three steps:
    - create volume
    - overwrite the created volume with the one downloaded from glance
    - resize the volume
    As opposed to fill the bytes from glance to the created image. This
    approach works more effective with XenServer type semi ovf tgz -ed vhds.

    Fix inability to delete volumes in error state for NetApp driver
    
    While using NetApp 7-mode storage box to create volumes, if the volume
    is not created on the storage box (possibly due to wrong/missing
    options in cinder.conf file), the volume goes in error state, and when
    one tries to delete the volume, an exception was raised which made
    the volume go in error_deleting state, which is unrecoverable. This
    commit quiesces that exception, resulting in successful removal of the
    volume entry from the volume table.
    
    Fixes bug 1090167

    Copy glance_image_metadata when cloning volumes.
    
    When cloning a volume we were not capturing/copying
    the glance_image_metadata from the source volume.
    
    This change implements a copy_image_metadata_from_vol_to_vol.
    So now we can clone bootable volumes without going back to glance
    or messing with them otherwise, they're just ready to be booted.
    
    Fixes bug: 1115634

    Add volume_glance_metadata to volume.api.get
    
    The dict(rv.iteritems()) agains the volume object from
    volume.api.get does NOT set the volume_glance_metadata k/v.
    
    This is used to show bootable in the show and list api calls,
    the result was that list properly reflected the bootable status
    of a volume, however show would always describe the flag as False.
    
    So we simply check if the rv includes the glance_metadata and if
    so go ahead and create the entry in the volume dict.

    Fix the generalized copy_image_to_volume operation.
    
    The Generis iSCSI copy volume<->image patch
    (change: Iff097629bcce9154829a7eb5aee0ea6302338b26) did
    not account for the fact that the existing volume reference
    passed in to the copy method would not have the updated
    provider_location and iSCSI info available.
    
    To address this, we simply just get a new ref from the DB
    after creation if a copy image is requested.
    
    Also, the list of acceptable formats was not fully inclusive,
    not only that, but there's no reason to not let the qemu-convert
    handle any errors here.

    Allow volume back-end to report 'infinite' or 'unknown' as capacity
    
    For some reason, some volume back-ends cannot report actual capacity
    that is available or even total capacity (e.g. thin-provisioning),
    Cinder should allow such capability report and make placement/schedule
    decision based on these status.
    
    In particular, we agree to use 'infinite' to mark unlimited space and
    'unknown' to mark unknown/unclear space.  Host manager and CapacityFilter
    are updated accordingly to allow such capacity.  For those back-ends
    report 'infinite' or 'unknown' capacity, CapacityFilter will let them
    pass to give them a chance to try.  Even if failure happened, the retry
    mechanism should take care of the case.

    Implement LVM thin provisioning support.
    
    As of LVM2 version 2.02.89 the ability to do thin provisioning
    was made available in LVM, this provides some cool new features
    but also addresses some problems with things like terrible
    LVM snapshot performance.
    
    Currently the version of LVM in Ubuntu 12.04 does NOT support LVM thin,
    however an experimental PPA from brightbox which is a backport from
    Quantal has been proposed to Cannonical to be pulled in.  For some
    users the experimental PPA is a better option than dealing with some of
    the current issues in the standard LVM2 version of Precise (including
    the dd hangs on secure delete). See BP for more info.
    
    This change will create the thin pool if it doesn't exist
    using pool_size flag, or by default using entire VG space.
    
    Implements BP: implement-lvm-thin-provisioning

    Check for installed cinder in filter tests.
    
    Some of the filter tests require that the cinder pkg is
    installed on the system, specifically cinder.egg-info/entry_points.
    
    This change check that the egg-info directory exists in the root
    cinder directory and determines whether to skip or not.

    Check for non-default volume name template.
    
    The iscsi delete methods in iscsi.py had hard-coded volume names
    'volume-%s'.
    
    If a user configured volume_name_template to
    something other than default the result is failure to remove
    the iscsi_target.
    
    volume create worked appropriately and created the correct name
    in the DB, so the persistence files were the only thing affected
    or named incorrectly.

    Get updated vol status in volume.api.reserve.
    
    A race condtion was discovered where a nova volume attach
    could easily be performed twice for the same volume.  Although
    the cinder attach update would fail, this occured after the BDM
    updates were made and in essence the attach to the compute instance
    had already been issued.
    
    This change simply forces a get from the DB of the volume-ref in the
    reserve call and checks if an attach is already in progress.

    ensure zeros are written out when clearing volumes
    
    Note O_DIRECT is _not_ used when copying from /dev/zero
    and there are issues with enabling that (see 444cd542).
    Therefore we arrange to have dd issue an fdatasync()
    to ensure the data is persisted, lest it be discarded
    from the write cache when the device is unprovisioned.
    
    * cinder/volume/drivers/lvm.py (_copy_volume): Add 'conv=fdatasync'
    to the dd option list if O_DIRECT isn't used when clearing
    (which it won't as descrived above).

    support a configurable volume wiping method
    
    Add a clear_volume() method that is called from delete_method().
    This is only implemented at present for the base LVM driver.
    This new clear_volume() method now supports these config vars:
    
      volume_clear = none, zero, shred
      volume_clear_size = size_in_MiB
    
    'zero' is the default method and unchanged from previously.
    'none' is used if security isn't a concern, or there is
      independent volume scrubbing.
    'shred' is for more security conscious situations where
    an overwrite count is required. Currently this defaults to 3 passes.
    
    size_in_MiB can be used to limit the cleared area to the first
    part of the volume, which can greatly speed up the operation,
    and can be useful with encrypted volumes for example where
    overwritting the encryption keys at the start is sufficient.

    Relax various version constraints.
    
    The current 3rd-party module requirements for cinder are still from the
    nova git import. Usually, having an upper bound for requirements makes
    only sense where API-incompatible changes are expected (like WebOb). For
    the others it is better the only require a minimum version because
    usually distributions differ on the shipped versions of these Python
    modules. For instance, openSUSE has newer versions for almost all of
    those and running the testsuite there works flawlessly.

    Factor out LVM code.
    
    Currently volume drivers inherit from VolumeDriver and ISCSIDriver,
    which contain LVM-specific code. The LVM-specific functions are
    generally overridden. The problem is that there is no place for
    generic code for all drivers to inherit, which the LVM driver can
    override. This patch basically makes the VolumeDriver and ISCSIDriver
    classes mostly empty and moves the LVM-specific code to lvm.py. Also,
    moved the global _iscsi_location() and _iscsi_authentication()
    functions into the new LVMISCSIDriver class since nobody else used
    them.

    Implement filter scheduler
    
    In order to do more sophisticated scheduling (e.g. schedule based on volume
    type), filter scheduler is introduced. Several changes are made to make this
    possible, some of them are similar to the counterpart in Nova:
    
    - add HostState class to host_manager in order to store volume capabilities
    - implement get_volume_stats() method of iSCSIDriver as an example to
    demonstrate how volume backend driver reports capabilities as well as status
    - add scheduler_options.py and 'scheduler_json_config_location' flag to be
    allow loading json configuration file for scheduler at run time
    - port common filters/weights from oslo
    - add capacity weigher (scheduler/weights/capacity.py) for picking up
    target volume backend by weighing free capacity of the host. The default
    behavior is to spread volumes across hosts; by changing the
    'capacity_weight_multiplier' to negative number, volume placing behavior will
    become stacking.
    - add capacity filter which filters those hosts have insufficient storage space
    to serve the request.
    - add 'reserved_percentage' config option to indicate how much space is
    reserved. Capacity reservation is needed when volume resize is enabled.
    - add 'publish_service_capabilities()' method to volume RPC API to allow
    scheduler to have volume service report capabilities. This bumps volume RPC
    API to version 1.2
    - remove 'volume_force_update_capabilities' config option, volume status will be
    report to scheduler in every checking.
    
    The implication of this change to storage/backend driver developer:
    - implementation of get_volume_stats() of the driver is now a *MUST*, filter
    scheduler heavily relies on the status/capabilities reported by backend driver
    to makeplacement decision.  To ensure Cinder works seamlessly on the storage
    system, driver should at least report following capabilities/status:

                          | string or list of strings | ['iSCSI', 'NFS', 'FC']

      'total_capacity_gb' | capacity in GB, integer   |  102400
    ----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------

                          | integer                   |
    ----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
    'reserved_percentage' | reserved space in         |  0, 10
                          | percentage, integer       |
    ----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
    
    The implication of this change to Cinder administrator:
    - the default setting for filter scheduler should work well with the benefits
    of:
      * being able to fully utilize capacity of backends (driver now has to report
      actul total space and space utilization and scheduler uses these info) not
      limited by the 'max_gigabytes' config option any more;
      * being able to choose placement policy between spreading & stacking for
      volume creation (by modifying the 'capacity_weight_multiplier' in
      CapacityWeigher)
    - with filter scheduler, Cinder is now able to utilize the advanced features/
    capabilities provided by different storage back-ends via: defining different
    volume types with proper extra_specs. Volume types can be considered as sets
    of back-end capabilities requirement.
     For example, a volume type which has 'storage_protocol':'FC' key/value pair
    definition in its extra_spec can only be served by those back-ends who report
    they support FiberChannel protocol. Another example is volume type has 'QoS'
    requirement can only be served by back-ends support QoS.
    
    Note/TODO:
    * Currently scheduler makes its decision based on the status and capabilities
    information reported by volume nodes, and these information is stored in memory
    of scheduler process. More sophisticated way may be add on table in DB to
    record status/capabilities of all volume nodes, like Nova does for compute nodes.

    Provide HP 3PAR array iSCSI driver
    
    implements blueprint hp3par-volume-driver
    
    We have the driver broken into 2 files:
    hp_3par_common.py and
    hp_3par_iscsi.py
    
    The reason we do this is because we have a fibre channel driver
    that will be submitted shortly after this is committed.   The
    fibre channel driver and the iscsi driver share a lot of the same
    code that talks to the 3PAR array for provisioning.  So,
    it made sense not to have duplicate code.  The fibre channel driver
    will be dependent on the fibre channel support I am actively working
    on for nova/cinder grizzly release.
    
    The driver uses a 2 mechanisms to talk to the 3PAR array:
    1) a python REST client (hp3parclient) that lives in the pypi
       repository here:
       http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hp3parclient
    
    2) SSH.  We had to pull in some of the ssh code from the base san
       driver to help fix an issue with executing commands on the 3PAR
       array.  The 3PAR has the ability to turn on CSV output for command
       results, which makes this easier to parse.  Unfortunately, there
       is no way to turn CSV mode on permanently for all ssh requests.
       So, we have to turn on the CSV output for every single ssh command
       issued.  Since we use ssh as well, we require the san_* options
       to be set.
    
    We use a dual mechianism because the REST API that ships with the 3.1.2
    firmware doesn't support all of the capabilities a cinder driver needs
    to export volumes.
    
    When a newer version of the firmware comes out that supports host
    management on the 3PAR array, then we will get rid of the SSH code.

    format checking in our tests by setting fatal_exception_format_errors=True.

    Implement filter scheduler
    
    In order to do more sophisticated scheduling (e.g. schedule based on volume
    type), filter scheduler is introduced. Several changes are made to make this
    possible, some of them are similar to the counterpart in Nova:
    
    - add HostState class to host_manager in order to store volume capabilities
    - implement get_volume_stats() method of iSCSIDriver as an example to
    demonstrate how volume backend driver reports capabilities as well as status
    - add scheduler_options.py and 'scheduler_json_config_location' flag to be
    allow loading json configuration file for scheduler at run time
    - port common filters/weights from oslo
    - add capacity weigher (scheduler/weights/capacity.py) for picking up
    target volume backend by weighing free capacity of the host. The default
    behavior is to spread volumes across hosts; by changing the
    'capacity_weight_multiplier' to negative number, volume placing behavior will
    become stacking.
    - add capacity filter which filters those hosts have insufficient storage space
    to serve the request.
    - add 'reserved_percentage' config option to indicate how much space is
    reserved. Capacity reservation is needed when volume resize is enabled.
    - change default scheduler to 'filter.FilterScheduler'.
    - add 'publish_service_capabilities()' method to volume RPC API to allow
    scheduler to have volume service report capabilities. This bumps volume RPC
    API to version 1.2
    - remove 'volume_force_update_capabilities' config option, volume status will be
    report to scheduler in every checking.
    
    The implication of this change to storage/backend driver developer:
    - implementation of get_volume_stats() of the driver is now a *MUST*, filter
    scheduler heavily relies on the status/capabilities reported by backend driver
    to makeplacement decision.  To ensure Cinder works seamlessly on the storage
    system, driver should at least report following capabilities/status:
    ----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------

                          | string or list of strings | ['iSCSI', 'NFS', 'FC']
    ----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------

                          | percentage, integer       |

    - the default setting for filter scheduler should work well with the benefits
    of:

    for the LVM case we create a temporary snapshot to copy from so that
    volumes can remain attached during cloning.  This works by passing
    in a source-volume-id to the create command (similar to create-from-snapshot).
    
    Currently we limit clone to the same Cinder node, and only for the base LVM driver.
    All other drivers should raise NotImplemented, most inherit from the SANISCSIDriver,
    so move the function there and raise until we have a general implementation
    for SANISCSI based drivers.
    
    Those drivers that inherit from ISCSI directly instead of SANISCSI,
    add the function explicitly and raise NotImplementedError there as well.

    Add EMC Volume Driver in Cinder
    
    Add support for EMC storage in the Cinder-Volume service.
    This driver is based on the existing ISCSIDriver, with the ability to
    create/delete and attach/detach volumes and create/delete snapshots, etc.
    The Cinder Driver executes the volume operations by communicating with the
    backend EMC storage. It uses a CIM client in python called PyWBEM to make
    CIM operations over HTTP.
    EMC CIM Object Manager (ECOM) is packaged with the SMI-S Provider. It is a
    CIM server that allows CIM clients to make CIM operations over HTTP, using
    SMI-S in the backend for EMC storage operations.
    SMI-S Provider supports the SNIA Storage Management Initiative (SMI), an
    ANSI standard for storage management. It supports VMAX/VMAXe and VNX
    storage systems.

    Added the lockutils, fileutils, gettextutils
    
    The 3par driver, for both iSCSI and Fibre Channel,
    that I will commit soon, needs the lockutils to ensure thread safety in
    each of the driver entry points.  The driver uses a single shared http
    session for all of it's connections to the 3par drive array.
    This is required for the driver because of the limitation on the
    3par's WSAPI only supporting a very small number of open connections.
    
    For example without this, the driver will have problems when 2 users try and
    create a volume at the same time.   I've discovered this in my threaded
    stress test tool.

    Add image metadata API extension
    
    This patch introduces an API extension that will expose the volume
    metadata inherited from the image if the volume was created from an image.
    
    This data will be used by Nova when booting from volume without any
    image supplied.
    
    In addition, the patch introduces a helper method on the volume.API
    class for accessing the image metadata and also updates the policy.json
    files to be aware of the new extension.

    Make copy_to_volume a bit more useful.
    
    The current implementation of cinder.driver.copy_to_volume
    does not take in to account image type and is only valid
    for raw images.  This doesn't do much good for the majority
    of cases, and rather than require folks to have a raw version
    uploaded to Glance, let's just do a convert if needed on the fly.
    
    This simply creates a temp file, does the conversion and then
    writes the temp file directly to the volume.

    Convert volume_type id from int to uuid.
    
    This converts the volume_type id from int to uuid.  In
    addition, this also corrects an issue of deleting volume_types
    by name.  Even though the client/api is taking the id, it was
    converting to the name of the volume_type for the db access.
    
    We also want to continue enforcing that the name is unique on creation
    so as to avoid any confusion and for clarity in Horizon.  The api
    has also been enhanced to allow you to specify the type by name
    or by uuid.
    
    This does NOT modify the things like the volume details display field
    (currently shows the type 'name' not 'uuid'), these types of changes
    will go in to V2 of the API.

    Ensure request_spec can be serialized.
    
    request_spec includes some objects that must be converted to primitive
    types to ensure they can be serialized by any of the rpc drivers.  In
    this case, it's the volume type.  It's a sqlalchemy model.
    to_primitive() will ensure that it gets converted to a dict so that it
    can be serialized for messaging.
    
    I saw this error in a smokestack log that was running tempest with qpid.
    You won't see this error if you're using rabbit with the kombu driver.
    We have some magic with the kombu driver that will fix these problems
    automatically if they are missed.

    attaching volumes will set instance_uuid instantly
    
    This change allows the instance_uuid field to be set instantly when
    beginning an attach action. The user will no longer have to wait for the
    attachment to be complete to know what it is attaching to. If attaching
    fails on the driver layer, we got error state and keep the instance_uuid
    set for troubleshooting purposes.

    Revert changes to monkey_patch.
    
    As a work-around to deal with bug 1075838, we modified
    monkey_patch in the Cinder binaries.  The root cause of the
    issue is/was actually a bug in eventlet but this was a quick
    work-around.
    
    Since the change Change-Id: I69ba75136e32e95c6fdf108f0c4fe21a5e3bdbe6
    to do this landed, the problem has also been addressed in Keystone.
    
    So, let's revert this patch to get back the greenthread performance
    that we may have lost with this change.  For now, everything should
    be addressed as long as we don't implement multi api worker in Cinder,
    if we do and the evenlet fix hasn't been released we'll need to turn
    the modification back on for bin/cinder-api.

    NetApp direct to filer drivers for iscsi and nfs.
    
    The drivers are designed to work with 7 mode and cluster storage systems.
    The drivers are designed to communicate with the NetApp storage controllers
    directly without requiring any intermediate management softwares in place using
    the NetApp api. Hence these represent the direct to filer versions of NetApp drivers.
    This also contains conventional nfs driver for cluster systems which requires
    NetApp management software as middle layer. Implementation for cloning support
    and basic volume type scheduler support in driver added. All NetApp drivers
    shifted into separate NetApp package. NetApp api refactored into a separate file
    other than drivers.

    This adds the hosts extension to Cinder which is similar to
    the extension by the same name in Nova.
    
    This extension allows an admin user to check the status of
    Cinder services on different hosts.  In addition it also

    Scheduler API clean up and refactor
    
    Unlike Nova scheduler, which has to consider serving compute and volume
    scheduling, Cinder scheduler only serves volume scheduling, so there's no
    need to keep generic interface 'schedule'. Instead, 'schedule_create_volume'
    is added (if missing) to manager/driver class and chance/simple scheduler
    driver implementation.
    
    Also this patch changes the interface between API service and scheduler to
    allow more information about volume is passed to scheduler for advanced
    scheduling while maintained backward compatibility. And this change bumps
    scheduler RPC API to version 1.2.

    Remove dm_setup(remove) call in volume_delete.
    
    While it makes sense to perform the dm_setup(remove) before
    performing the lvm remove, it seems to cause some buffer IO
    errors as evident by kern.log.
    
    I'm also a bit suspicous in that it seems the delete timeouts
    we see seems to have increased in frequency with this addition.
    I propose this step is removed until we completely understand the
    impact of the kernel error on Precise kernels.

    Fix run_tests.sh ambiguous usage msg and behaviour for -x option
    
    In commit
    https://github.com/openstack/cinder/commit/
    50792c2ff41fdc7e73b3e3c51f4510366debfd14,
    the committer wanted to add an option in run_tests.sh for generating XML
    coverage report, but ended up accidentally overriding the default nose
    option -x. But, the usage message still showed that using option -x will
    'Stop running tests after the first error or failure'. So, I changed the
    option to generate XML report to  -X (capitalized 'x'). So now both -x and
    -X options are available, with different purposes.

    Add admin only action for force detach
    
    This action calls the same methods nova would after it successfully
    detaches a volume.  By exposing it to the administrator it makes it's
    easier to repair un-syncronized state between services.  Generally when
    the host is no longer attached, but the volume state is wrong.
    
    Future work: The Iscsi based drivers don't seem to use
    initialize_connection and terminate_connection to create the export for
    the volume.  This would be more useful with drivers that do that.
    
    I added the force parameter to terminate_connection for drivers that may
    want to differintiate between a normal terminate and the force detach.
    
    Future Nova work:  Nova will want an admin action to update the bdm
    tables - today it's a bit of nova-manage shell work.

    Fix 401 from auth_token middleware
    
    The openssl popen call to verify the token returns an error code
    of 2 when a file doesn't exist. Normally this is caught and the
    relevant file is downloaded, but monkeypatching os causes this
    error code to be eaten and cinder to return a 401. Note that this
    is likely a race condition that depends on exactly when greenthreads
    are switching that is causing the return code from Popen to get
    overwritten.
    
    It is possible that this is exposing an underlying bug in eventlet
    but the workaround is simply to make sure that we don't monkeypatch
    os.

    Return volume type name on volume create
    
    Update openstack api controller for volumes to fully inflate the
    returned volume model on create to populate the volume_type fields so
    the response serializer will return the name of the volume_type instead
    of the id on volume create requests.  Returning the name on create is
    consistent with the show and index commands.

    Detect and fix issues caused by vol ID migration
    
    The migration from volume ID to UUID neglected to update the provider_location
    field on the volume.  As a result the iqn and volume name no long match and
    existing volumes are no longer able to be attached after an upgrade
    (essex -> folsom and then nova-vol->cinder).
    
    This patch adds a method to the volume driver that will check for the
    mismatch of volume name in the iqn during service start up.  If
    detected it will update the provider_location field in the database
    to include the new ID.  Also it will create a symlink to the device backing
    file that also has the correct naming convention.
    
    Note: We don't disturb an connections that are currently attached.
    For this case we add a check in manager.detach and do any provider_location
    cleanup that's needed at that time.  This ensures that connections
    persist on restarts of tgtd and reboot.

    Add default volume type flag
    
    Where using volume type scheduler, 'volume type' is an essential input for
    scheduler to perform sophysticated scheduling.  This patch adds a new
    flag 'default_volume_type to allow admin to set one volume type as the
    default type for volume creation if user doesn't specify any.
    
    Also add more clear 404 message to API if create request provided non-existing
    volume type.
    
    Note: Setting the 'default_volume_type' flag to non-existing volume type
    is problematic and should be avoided, and the outcome of such behavior is
    equivlant to setting default volume type to None.
    
    This is part of patch set implementing 'volume-type-scheduler'.

    Allow the user to update a volume's metadata
    
    The fix mainly involves updating the VolumeController's update method
    to allow the 'metadata' key to be a valid key in a request body.
    
    The _translate_volume_summary_view method is updated to check for a
    'metadata' key in the vol parameter after checking first for
    'volume_metadata'.  This is to avoid making a third call to the
    database after updating the volume model.  This solution introduces
    the least amount of new code.

    Loosen anyjson dependency to avoid clash with ceilometer
    
    Ceilometer depends on anyjson 0.3.1, whereas cinder requires
    exacly 0.2.4.
    
    The net effect is a devstack with ceilometer installed will
    appear to work initially, as ceilometer is sparked up after
    cinder. However, if any of the cinder services are subsequently
    restarted, they fail with:
    
      pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: anyjson==0.2.4
    
    By simply allowing the cinder anyjson dependency version to
    be greater than as opposed to an exact match, we can avoid
    the clash.

    Remove unused code: check_for_export.
    
    This code has been unused since cinder was split from nova.  It used to
    be used as a safety check during live migration.  The check was removed
    recently in nova, since it wasn't being used with Cinder anyway (just
    nova-volumes).
    
    An alternative approach would be to expose this from Cinder somehow if
    we feel it's important, but until then, there's no reason to keep dead
    code around.

    removes this handler, so don't create it. Note that there may be
    a small period before the logging setup is finished where messages
    will not appear.

    Restore SIGPIPE default action for subprocesses
    
    Python ignores SIGPIPE on startup, because it prefers to check every

    Update quota when deleting volume that failed to be scheduled
    
    If one volume was failed to get scheduled, removing such volume should
    also clean up reservation.
    Also when create_volume is ready to send to scheduler, reservation
    should be committed no matter backend can successfully create that
    volume or not since deleting volume call will do a minus reservation
    even on volume with 'error' status.

    Add a resume delete on volume manager startup
    
      Currently if for some reason the volume service was stopped
      during the zero out operation of a volume delete there was
      no way to get the volume removed from the system (it would
      be present in deleting status forever).
    
      This change adds a simple check of volumes in the DB with status
      of deleting, and if any are found it restarts the delete process
      on them.
    
      addresses bug #1011150

    Add update to volume and snapshot controllers
    
    Add update method to api.openstack.volume.volumes and snapshots
    controllers.  Url mapping automatically routes a PUT on the resource to
    the update method.  Implementation closely matches updates to server
    resource for the openstack compute api.
    
    e.g.
    
    curl http://localhost:8776/v1/${PROJECT_ID}/volumes/${VOLUME_ID} \
        -H 'x-auth-token: ${ADMIN_AUTH_TOKEN}' \
        -H 'content-type: application/json' \
        -XPUT -d '{"volume": {"display_name": "new-name"}}'
    
    Add volume.api.API.update_snapshot method to avoid making db calls
    directly from the SnapshotsController.
    
    Add tests for new methods.
    
    Update return value of test_volume.VolumeTestCase._create_snapshot
    to return the whole model like _create_volume

    Don't zero out snapshot volume on snapshot_delete
    
     When trying to zero out an LVM snapshot on precise the kernel sometimes
     hangs when performing the dd.  Also the dd process itself can take
     an extremely long time even when it does succesfully complete.
     This can be up to 30 minutes for a 1 Gig volume/snapshot.
    
     I believe this is a kernel specific issue with LVM snapshots.  The
     zeroing process is unreliable and can cause kernel hangs to let's remove it.
    
     In order to protect against data leakage we'll implement the zeroing process
     on volume creation.  This doesn't seem to have a significant impact and doesn't
     suffer from the same isues tha zeroing out an LVM snapshot does.
    
     No reason to continue zero on delete, the zero on creation should
     probably be sufficient.
    
     Doesn't seem to cause any timing issues but need to keep this in mind.

    Recent changes to SolidFire API changed iqn format
    
     The SF API initially didn't supply the in prefix so we
     formed it manually in the OpenStack driver.
    
     This has been fixed in the API so we dropped the manual
     build of the prefix in volume create.  Unfortunatly missed

    Note: I've left the cinder-specific change to use cinder's context
    rather than openstack-common's context.

    avoid the buffer cache when copying volumes
    
    The dd process when clearing volumes, was seen to starve
    the system when writing to an iSCSI SAN connected over GigE.
    
    So use O_DIRECT within the dd process so that the system
    buffer cache is not impacted, which is generally the
    best thing to do when streaming large amounts of data.
    
    Also one could drop the I/O priority of the dd process
    by prepending "ionice -c3". That would change the priority
    from "normal" (best effort) to "idle", which means zeroing
    will only proceed when there is no other I/O on the system.
    It was thought best to leave scheduling decisions to the
    system however, rather than specifying them explicitly.

    Filter volumes and snapshots by query string
    
    Fix query string search_opts filters in api.openstack.volume.volumes and
    snapshots.  Fix get_all methods in volumes.api to adequately handle
    parameter matching.
    
    The current api does not properly apply query string filters by
    display_name, status, or (in the case of snapshots) volume_id.  These
    filters are needed both for the end user and operator to display logical
    grouping of these resources.

    Add admin actions extension
    
    The optional os-admin-actions extension adds new wsgi_actions to the
    volumes/action resource and a new snapshots/action endpoint.
    
    With this extension both controllers will support an os-reset_status
    action to force a database update of a volume or snapshot that is stuck
    in a failed/incorrect status.  The os-reset_status action works
    similarly to the compute api's os-reset_state action for instances.
    
    The os-force_delete action behaves similarly to the "cinder-manage
    volume delete" command and allows operators/admins to retry the delete
    operation after it has gone into an error_deleting status with an admin
    api call.
    
    The os-admin-actions extension is enabled by default, but limited to the
    admin api by the default policy.json rules.  Individual admin actions
    can be disabled with policy rules as well.
    
    Example of os-reset_status action on a volume:
    
    curl http://localhost:8776/v1/${PROJECT_ID}/volumes/${VOLUME_ID}/action \
        -H 'x-auth-token: ${ADMIN_AUTH_TOKEN}' \
        -H 'content-type: application/json' \
        -d '{"os-reset_status": {"status": "error"}}'
    
    The new admin only api can assist deployers who encounter bugs or
    operational issues that result in failed actions.
    
    It can also be used by future storage backends to support async callback
    style status updates from long running actions or operations which have
    encountered an error will be retried.
    
    Also updates the api.openstack.wsgi.ControllerMetaclass to support
    sub-classing wsgi.Controllers that define wsgi_actions.
    
    Partial fix for bug #1039706

    Make size optional when creating a volume from a snap
    
    Changing the size of a volume when cloning a snapshot doesn't
    make a great deal of sense *and isn't part of the ec2 api).
    
    This patch makes the field optional, defaulting to the same
    size as the snapshot (and therefore the origination volume).

    Fix creation of iscsi targets
    
    Previously when creating iscsi volumes, we were using
    
    tgt-admin -e -c <config file> --update volume-id
    
    Unfortunately the side affect of this is that tgt-admin
    removed other volumes that weren't connected to an iscsi
    connector. Which is obvlously not what we want.
    
    In order to fix this we create the targets.conf for the
    volume but we call tgt-admin --update icssi qualified name.
    
    We're dropping the use of iscsi_targets table when using TgtAdm.
    Compatability for other target admin types is maintained.

    glanceclient can raise HTTPNotFound (as well as NotFound) it appears,
    but glance image service is only converting NotFound ->
    InstanceNotFound.  Same applies to 'Forbidden' and other exceptions.
    
    This patch converts 'exc_type is NotFound'-like checks to use
    'isinstance' instead, which will cover HTTPNotFound, etc.

    a problem and it does nothing if it succeeds. The tests should just
    check whether an exception was raised.

    add ability to clone images
    
    Given the backend location from Glance, drivers can determine
    whether they can clone or otherwise efficiently create a volume
    from the image without downloading all the data from Glance.
    
    For now implement cloning for the RBD driver. There's already a
    Glance backend that stores images as RBD snapshots, so they're
    ready to be cloned into volumes. Fall back to copying all the
    data if cloning is not possible.

    rbd: implement create_volume_from_snapshot
    
    In an upcoming release, rbd will support creating volumes from
    snapshots ('cloning'). To clone a snapshot, it must first be
    'protected', which means it cannot be deleted until it is unprotected.
    A snapshot can only be unprotected if no clones depend on it. Thus,
    translate a failure to unprotect into a SnapshotIsBusy exception.
    
    Also check for remaining snapshots before deleting a volume,
    and raise VolumeIsBusy if any exist. While we're here, tidy up
    the shell arguments to be more readable.
    
    This is backwards compatible since it does not use the new features
    unless they are available in the installed version of rbd.

    storwize-svc: improved test coverage and fixes.
    
    Added test cases to cover more error paths, now providing 97% test
    coverage of the storwize-svc driver. Some tests uncovered bugs in the
    driver, which are fixed by this patch. In addition, there are some
    fixes to the code included which address comments from the submission
    of this driver to nova-volume and sync the two versions.

    Remove redundant 'availability_zone' config options.
    
    There are two availability_zone related config options now:
      node_availability_zone and storage_availability_zone
    While volume API uses node_availability_zone, the scheduler uses
    the other, which causes failure in scheduler when these two options
    have different values.
    
    This patch removes 'node_availability_zone' so that end user
    can specify 'availability zone' when create volumes using
    Simple scheduler.

    Send 'create volume from snapshot' to the proper host
    
    A simple solution for bug 1008866. When creating volume from snapshot on
    multicluster, in volume it will check if snapshot_id is set. If snapshot_id
    is set, make the call create volume directly to the volume host where the
    snapshot resides instead of passing it through the scheduler. So snapshot can
    be copy to new volume.

    Add persistent volumes for tgtd.
    
    Currently if you restart the server running nova-volume
    or restart tgt, you will loose your iscsi targets that
    have been created. This is not good.
    
    In order for iscsi targets to be persistent across
    reboots or restarts, one has to have the target's configuration
    information in /etc/tgt/targets.conf or /etc/tgt/conf.d.
    So when tgtd is restarted then the iscsi targets will be there
    as expected.
    
    This patch will add a configuration file to $state_path/volumes
    when the volume is created. The configuration file is identified by
    the volume uuid. It creates a logicalunit when the volume is created
    as well. The iscsi target and configuration file
    will be removed once the volume has been removed as well.
    
    In order to use this, you have to include the following in
    your /etc/tgt/targets.conf
    
    include $state_path/volumes/*
    
    For upgrades, it will just re-create the volumes
    already in the volumes table.

    Include volume_metadata with object on vol create
    
    Fix for Bug 1029762
    
    The symptom of this bug is that the response data of an
    OSAPI create call always shows and empty dict for volume_metadata
    regardless of what was passed in to created and actually used.
    
    Upon the db create_volume call a reference to the volume
    object is all that was being returned.  Since metadata is
    specified and set, it should also be returned with the
    create reference object.
    
    This will result in the the osapi create call returning
    a body with correct metdata info rather than always showing
    and empty dict as it was previously.

    Use save_and_reraise_exception() from common.
    
    This patch common.excutils from openstack-common, which includes
    save_and_reraise_exception().  The patch also converts the code
    base to use it from there instead of cinder.utils and then removes
    it from cinder.utils.
    
    The initial motivation for this was removing another cinder dependency
    from cinder.rpc so that it can eventually be moved to openstack-common.

    This patch makes the rpc code use the global config object from
    openstack-common.  Based on some recent discussions on the mailing list,
    this may not be the final way configuration handling is done here, but
    it is certainly better than the register_opts() hack that is removed by
    this patch.

    Remove cinder.log usage from cinder.rpc.
    
    Part of blueprint common-rpc.
    
    This patch removes the usage of cinder.log from cinder.rpc.  This is
    necessary before cinder.rpc can be moved to openstack-common.  The rpc
    logging was not using any of the extra features provided in cinder.log as
    far as I can tell, so the changes are very simple.
    
    This is the final dependency.  After this change, the rpc code
    can be moved to openstack-common without any changes.

    Add version to scheduler rpc API.
    
    Part of blueprint versioned-rpc-apis.
    
    One side effect of this change was that cinder.scheduler.api was removed
    in favor of cinder.scheduler.rpcapi.  In this case, the api was just a
    direct wrapper around rpc usage.  For other APIs, I've been following
    the pattern that the rpcapi module provides the rpc client wrapper, and
    if any other client-side logic is needed, that's where an api module is
    used.

    The function queue_get_for() is a utility function used by various
    consumers of the rpc API.  This function lived in the db API, but never
    ended up using anything from the database.  This patch moves it into the
    rpc API so that it can be used by other users of rpc once it moves into
    openstack-common.

    Stop using cinder.exception from cinder.rpc.
    
    This patch is a part of continuing to remove dependencies from cinder.rpc
    on the rest of cinder.  One RPC related exception was defined in
    cinder.exception, so that was moved to cinder.rpc.common where the rest of
    them live.  These exceptions were changed to no longer use CinderException
    as their base.  Instead, there is a new RPCException base.
    
    One other change that should be reviewed closely is the removal of using
    cinder.exception.wrap_exception() in cinder.rpc.amqp.  As far as I can tell,
    this didn't actually do anything since nothing was being passed in to
    wrap_exception().

    Updated HpSanISCSIDriver to use initialize/terminate methods.

    HpSanISCSIDriver should adopt the change in order to work properly.
    Also added missing unit tests for the HpSanISCSIDriver.
    
    Fixes bug 992729.

    Cinder docs were not building because sphinx was looking for
    cinder-manage.rst which did not exist. The file was simply misnamed
    and renaming it to cinder-manage.rst allows the docs to build.
